# splave-ferris_pg1316s
A version of splave-ferris using the new Kailh PG1316S Ultra-low-profile scissor switches.

For more on the splave-ferris generally, see the readme in the base directory.

There are quite a few changes from the choc version of the board. Here are the most notable I could think of:

1. Keycaps for these switches are 16x16mm, so I changed the spacing accordingly. Several other dimensions were changed as needed.
2. I changed the battery connector from a JST to a Molex Pico EZMate, which surface mounts and has a much lower profile.
3. I removed the reset button, as the XIAO has one built in and this is my most minimalist design.
4. Battery connector and power switch are in new positions.
5. I switched from SOD-123 diodes to SOD-323 due to the diode pocket on the PG1316 having only 1.2mm of headspace.
6. Everything on the board is surface mount, and nothing is on the back of the board. This one can be manufactured in a single hotplate run.
7. The routing is somewhat cleaner, despite the all-SMD design requiring a lot of vias. I think I'm getting better.

As with the choc version, this is intended to be used without a case.

I created a schematic, but while I believe it to be accurate, it is not connected to the PCB files in any way, as they were generated by ergogen. Also, the PCB files you likely want are the _left and _right versions...the one without a direction includes both halves of the board, but the nets are all the same to that may cause problems. It is also unrouted, although if you do wish to do the routing differently there are also unrouted versions of each half.

I have included production gerber files. I am planning on ordering them soon, but as yet they are untested.

I remain very new at all this stuff. So if you see something wrong, please let me know!
