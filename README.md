# splave-ferris
Simple 34-key split ergonomic keyboard running ZMK on a Seeed XIAO BLE controller and supporting multiple switch types. Similar in layout to the Ferris Sweep except with a bit of finger splay.

My goals are to make the keyboard as small and thin as possibe while remaining comfortable, efficient, and relatively durable. That is the main rationale for not using hotswap switches; in addition to adding a bit of height, it makes the keys much less secure if you aren't using a case of some kind. I intend to plastidip the bottom and otherwise leave it raw.

The board is designed to be primarily assembled with SMD methods. I intend to use solder paste and a hotplate to surface mount the controller, button, switch, and all the diodes, leaving only the battery connector and keyswitches to manually solder. I may even experiment with doing those with a hot air rework station. In any case this is why the back is totatlly devoid of components.

At the moment I have only done the Choc v1 version, but I expect to have more soon. The layout is done in ergogen, so it's relatively easy to adapt as needed. The next switch implemented will likely be the new Kailh CPG1316S ultra-low profile scissor switch. In addition to being extremely low-profile, it is a surface-mount part; with an appropriate battery connector, I may be able to design it so it required no manual soldering at all. 

I remain very new at all this stuff. So if you see something wrong, please let me know!
