This is an ultra-low profile version using the new Kailh scissor switches. I haven't figured out how to make an ergogen footprint for it yet, so for now I just started with the Choc v1 pcb files and swapped the model in KiCad. I think that should work? I don't know for sure but I don't see why not. I will likely try to build it soon and see what happens.
